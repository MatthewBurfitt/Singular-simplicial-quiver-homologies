# Singular-simplicial-quiver-homologies
Extending singular homology to quivers in different categories, several homology theories have been constructed. We make use of isomorphisums between the quiver homologies and the homologies of certain spaces to created effective algorithms for computation.  Moreover, these constructions are natural and can be applied with persistent homology.
