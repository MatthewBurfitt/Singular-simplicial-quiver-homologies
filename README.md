# Overview

Extending singular homology to quivers in different categories, several homology theories have been constructed. We make use of isomorphisums between the quiver homologies and the homologies of certain spaces to created effective algorithms for computation.  Moreover, these constructions are natural and can be applied with persistent homology.


# Installation

Please note that the due to the use of the *Persistent Homology Algorithm Toolkit (phat)* for persistent homology computations with cell complexes, an earlier version of python and of some packages is required.

Required python packages: numpy (version 1.15.2), graphviz (version 0.14.2), phat (version 1.5.0).

Place a copy of "SingularQuiverHomologies.py" in your python path, nothing else is required other than Python 3 (version 3.5.6).


# Usage

Load the *SingularQuiverHomologies* library.

```python
import SingularQuiverHomologies as SQH
```
